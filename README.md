# Applied_ML
The primary business problem addressed in this project is to optimize the direct marketing  campaigns conducted by a Portuguese banking institution. These campaigns were based on  phone calls. Often, more than one contact with the same client was required, to assess if the  product (bank term deposit) would be subscribed to or not.
