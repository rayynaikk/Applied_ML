The primary business problem addressed in this project is to optimize the direct marketing  campaigns conducted by a Portuguese banking institution. These campaigns were based on  phone calls. Often, more than one contact with the same client was required, to assess if the  product (bank term deposit) would be subscribed to or not.

This problem falls under the domain of supervised learning. The dataset provides labeled instances, indicating whether a client subscribed to the bank term deposit “Yes” or “No”. By utilizing this labeled data, supervised learning algorithms can be trained to predict future outcomes based on similar customer characteristics and interaction patterns. The goal is to develop a predictive model that can classify potential clients into subscription categories, enabling the bank to focus its resources on individuals more likely to subscribe to the term deposit. 

Direct marketing campaigns are resource-intensive and require strategic planning to ensure a high return on investment. Understanding the factors influencing customers' subscription decisions is crucial for optimizing these campaigns. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the bank can analyze historical data to identify patterns and trends that indicate potential subscribers. This predictive analysis can significantly enhance the efficiency of the marketing efforts.
